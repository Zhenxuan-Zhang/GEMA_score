## üöÄ Overview  
**GEMA-Score** is a medical report evaluation framework that delivers **granular, explainable, multi-agent scoring** for automated medical report assessment.  
By combining **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with a **Multi-Agent Evaluation Strategy**, it evaluates both the **clinical accuracy** and the **linguistic quality** of medical reports.

Key evaluation aspects include:  
- **Key Medical Findings** ‚Äî Coverage and correctness of critical diagnostic information.  
- **Lesion Location** ‚Äî Accuracy of anatomical positioning.  
- **Severity Assessment** ‚Äî Correct grading of disease severity.  
- **Medical Terminology** ‚Äî Proper and precise use of medical terms.  
- **Readability & Clarity** ‚Äî Language quality for clinical communication.

## üì¶ Installation & Deployment

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Listed Endpoint (Recommended)
```bash
# Install required Python package
pip install requests
```
```python
import requests

# Dify API Configuration
DIFY_API_URL = "https://api.dify.ai/v1/chat-messages"
DIFY_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Example input medical reports
data = {
    "inputs": {
        "GroundTruth_medical_report": "The heart is normal in size. The lungs are clear.",
        "Candidate_medical_report": "No focal areas of consolidation. No pleural effusions."
    },
    "query": "Evaluate these medical reports.",
    "user": "user-123",
    "response_mode": "blocking"
}

# Set request headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {DIFY_API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send request to Dify API
response = requests.post(DIFY_API_URL, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())  # Print the response
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Local Deployment (Docker)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/GEMA-Score.git
cd GEMA-Score
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## üìö Usage Example (Local API)
```python
import requests

# Local API Configuration
url = "http://localhost:8000/score"
data = {"report": "Chest X-ray shows mild pleural effusion ..."}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Send request to local API
response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())  # Print the response
```
