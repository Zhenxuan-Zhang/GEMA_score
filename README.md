## üöÄ Project Overview

**GEMA-Score** is a medical report evaluation tool designed to provide a **granular, explainable, multi-agent scoring** mechanism for automated medical report assessment. It integrates **LLM (Large Language Model)** and **Multi-Agent Evaluation Strategy**, ensuring the assessment not only covers **key medical information** but also evaluates **lesion location, severity, medical terminology, and readability**.

> üéØ Online Demo: [GEMA-Score Demo](https://udify.app/chat/jPOWanLUMb0NAeKI)

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Agent Scoring Architecture**: Includes entity extraction, objective clinical accuracy, subjective expressiveness, and overall evaluation agents.
- üîç **Explainable Scoring**: Combines NER-F1, medical terminology consistency, LLM-based scoring, and more.
- ü§ñ **Easy Deployment with Dify**: Leverages LLM for a more reliable automated evaluation.
- üìä **Validated High Correlation**: Achieves Kendall correlation of 0.70 on Rexval dataset and 0.54 on RadEvalX dataset.
